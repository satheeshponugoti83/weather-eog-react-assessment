## Create React App Visualization

Issues encountered:

The chart Libray [Recharts](http://recharts.org/en-US/) used in this project is not reponsive to real time Data.
Since the time is kind of limited for me so I didn't try other Chart Libs
the chart is just staic plotting data retrieved from endpoint.

also didn't have time for making [snackbar error message](https://material-ui.com/components/snackbars/#snackbar)
